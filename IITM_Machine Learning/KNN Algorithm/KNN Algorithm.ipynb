    "# k-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "\n",
    "K-nearest neighbors (KNN) is a type of supervised learning algorithm which is used for both regression and classification purposes, but mostly it is used for the later. Given a dataset with different classes, KNN tries to predict the correct class of test data by calculating the distance between the test data and all the training points. It then selects the k points which are closest to the test data.  Once the points are selected, the algorithm calculates the probability (in case of classification) of the test point belonging to the classes of the k training points and the class with the highest probability is selected. In the case of a regression problem, the predicted value is the mean of the k selected training points.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s understand this with an illustration:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1)\tGiven a training dataset as given below. We have a new test data that we need to assign to one of the two classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"1.png\" width=\"\">\n",
    "                                      \n",
    "\n",
    "2)\tNow, the k-NN algorithm calculates the distance between the test data and the given training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"2.png\" width=\"\">\n",
    "\n",
    "                                                        \n",
    "3)\tAfter calculating the distance, it will select the k training points which are nearest to the test data. Let’s assume the value of k is 3 for our example.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"3.png\" width=\"\">                                            \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4)\tNow, 3 nearest neighbors are selected, as shown in the figure above. Let’s see in which class our test data will be assigned :\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of Green class values = 2\n",
    "Number of Red class values = 1\n",
    "Probability(Green) = 2/3\n",
    "Probability(Red) = 1/3\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the probability for Green class is higher than Red, the k-NN algorithm will assign the test data to the Green class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, if this were the case of a regression problem, the predicted value for the test data will simply be the mean of all the 3 nearest values.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the basic working algorithm for k-NN. Let’s understand how the distance is calculated :\n",
    "\n",
    "### Euclidean Distance: \n",
    "\n",
    "It is the most commonly used method to calculate the distance between two points.\n",
    "The Euclidean distance between two points ‘p(p1,p2)’ and ‘q(q1,q2)’ is calculated  as :\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"4.png\" width=\"\">       image source : Wikipedia\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"5.png\" width=\"\">\n",
    "\n",
    "                                          \n",
    "Similarly,for n-dimensional space, the Euclidean distance is given as :\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"6.png\" width=\"\">\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### Lazy Learners\n",
    "\n",
    "k-NN algorithms are often termed as Lazy learners. Let’s understand why is that. Most of the algorithms like Bayesian classification, logistic regression, SVM etc., are called Eager learners. These algorithms generalize over the training set before receiving the test data i.e. they create a model based on the training data before receiving the test data and then do the prediction/classification on the test data.\n",
    "But this is not the case with the k-NN algorithm. It doesn’t create a generalized model for the training set but waits for the test data. Once test data is provided then only it starts generalizing the training data to classify the test data.  So, a lazy learner just stores the training data and waits for the test set. Such algorithms work less while training and more while classifying a given test dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros and Cons of KNN Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "*\tIt can be used for both regression and classification problems.\n",
    "*\tIt is very simple and easy to implement.\n",
    "*\tMathematics behind the algorithm is easy to understand.\n",
    "*\tThere is no need to create model or do hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "*   KNN doesn't make any assumption for the distribution of the given data.\n",
    "*   There is not much time cost in training phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "*\tFinding the optimum value of ‘k’\n",
    "*\tIt takes a lot of time to compute the distance between each test sample and all training samples.\n",
    "*\tSince the model is not saved beforehand in this algorithm (lazy learner), so every time one predicts a test value, it follows the same steps again and again. \n",
    "*\tSince, we need to store the whole training set for every test set, it requires a lot of space.\n",
    "*\tIt is not suitable for high dimensional data.\n",
    "*   Expensive in testing phase\n",
