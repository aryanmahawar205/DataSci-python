    "## Pandas - Series\n",
    "\n",
    "Series in Pandas is just like a NumPy array. The only difference that lies here is that Series can have axis labels. Some data / object having an axis label means to say that it can be indexed by a label (which could essentially be anything you want) instead of the traditional 0 number indexing in Python. A series can also hold any arbitrary Python object or a collection of objects."
